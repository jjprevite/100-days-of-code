### Day 4: June 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. 3/4ths done with portfolio. Worked on adding in jQuery accordian

**Thoughts**: I was a little scared at first to learn how to make content collapsible because I didn't know where to start but thanks to Stack Overflow, I figured it out! Some content isn't centered yet and it's not fully responsive but it's getting closer!

### Day 3: June 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. Halfway done with portfolio

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good! Found this [great article](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/) on Flexbox that finally makes sense! :D Also, my portfolio is starting to look more and more real. I'm hoping to stick to a simple design.


### Day 2: June 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. Spent more time sketching and coding portfolio

**Thoughts**: I decided to go with Simple Grid instead of Bootstrap to practice relying less on a "big" framework and rely more on code I wrote myself. Yes, I'm using Simple Grid but it's a minimum framework. Currently, don't have a navbar on my site but wondering if I can make it simple enough not to need one? Having some issues with formatting of the header and sub-header. 


### Day 1: June 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. Started working on portfolio project. 

**Thoughts**: Wishing I had a better grasp of HTML/CSS to be able to quickly iterate what I want. Enjoying the learning process though!
