### Day 2: June 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. Spent more time sketching and coding portfolio

**Thoughts**: I decided to go with Simple Grid instead of Bootstrap to practice relying less on a "big" framework and rely more on code I wrote myself. Yes, I'm using Simple Grid but it's a minimum framework. Currently, don't have a navbar on my site but wondering if I can make it simple enough not to need one? Having some issues with formatting of the header and sub-header. 


### Day 1: June 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 60 minutes. Started working on portfolio project. 

**Thoughts**: Wishing I had a better grasp of HTML/CSS to be able to quickly iterate what I want. Enjoying the learning process though!
