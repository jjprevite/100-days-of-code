<!--### Day #: DATE

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: -->


### Day 1: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've finished 6 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I'm 74% done with the Javascript module.

**Thoughts** I'm feeling pretty good! I struggled a few times with two challenges today but I worked through them and it felt great!


### Day 2: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I struggled for one hour and didn't complete the "Counting Cards" challenege in the Javascript module. But then, I took a break, thought about it, wrote out some ideas and tested them and found the solution!

**Thoughts**: It was frustrating. At first, I didn't understand what desired outcome was but after doing some research and reading about what other people were trying to do, I realized there were multiple ways to solve it. I didn't complete it because I ran out of time but later found some time to try a few other ideas and solved it! As I delve deeper into the tutorials on FCC, I realize I'm going to need to be creative with the ways I solve the upcoming exercises. 


### Day 3: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I coded for 1 hour. I completed 8 Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. One of the challenges was tough because I had to modify a line of code that was above the line that says "Only change code below the line." So I submitted an issue on the FCC repository- it was my first time doing so. I considered teaching myself how to submit pull requests but decided that should be left for another day with more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm still enjoying coding! Instead of getting frustrated when I don't complete a challenge first try, I stop, take a breath, and try to figure out what might be wrong. It's a habit I want to build early on, especially if I decide to pursue coding as a career. Since I didn't finish the last challenge I was on, I feel anxious to work on it again and solve it. If I have more time tonight, I'll work on it. Otherwise, I'll solve it tomorrow


### Day 4: February 9th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 1 hour at a Starbucks in Dana Point. I finished 8 Javascript exercises on FCC. Still having some trouble understanding arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! I cranked through those 8 problems and got stuck towards the end of the hour on the 9th challenge "Nested for Loops." I'll figure it out tomorrow. 


### Day 5: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 35 minutes. Wish I had more time. I started "Profile Lookup" challenge but didn't have time to try it more than once. Hopefully I can finish the last 8 Javascript challenges tomorrow or before Monday. 

**Thoughts**: Life is good. Code is good. I am really enjoying this because it brings me back to the days in  Pre-Calc and Calculus when I would have to try a bunch of different ways to get the solution. It's a challenge and I'm ready for it. Bring it on.


### Day 6: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I coded for 2 hours at the library. I finally finished the Javascript module and the Object Oriented and Functional Programming module. Now onto the Basic Algorithm Scripting module.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little nervous for the next module but as long as I believe in myself and put in the work, I know I'll be able to figure them out.

### Day 7: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes and finished my first algorithm problem! It was simpler than I thought. I learned that I can run/execute methods on the return line in JS. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good! I'm excited for more algorithm problems because I think they'll be fun. As a kid, I remember playing Madden and other sports games, thinking about how the video game figured out where to put the yellow line for the first down and what the algorithm looked like in my head. 

### Day 8: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes trying to solve Factorals in the second basic algorithm module. I know the formula but haven't quite figured out how to tell in it words that Javascript understands.

**Thoughts**: Felt frustrated today but let it pass on, like a cloud. Tomorrow, I'll work and figure it out (I hope). 


### Day 9: February 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes and figured out the second algorithm on FCC!

**Thoughts**: Feeling good but read this https://goo.gl/5OGPXi and now second guessing the path I'm on. Going to spend a few days thinking about what's the best track and what my goals should be.

### Day 10: February 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Didn't accomplish much. Watched a few videos on Javascript. Trying to figure out how to start writing my code in my own text editor.

**Thoughts**: Feeling some "resistance" but no one said it was going to be easy! Still trotting along with a big smile.


### Day 11: February 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Feeling fantastic! Had an okay day but coding sure has me in high spirits! Read up to page 31 in YDKJS, Up and Going. Practiced JS in the Chrome dev tools console- super cool!

**Thoughts**: I can totally do this! I felt overwhelmed the other day but I'm feeling good now! On track.   


### Day 12: February 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Feeling good still. Finished Chp1 of YDKJS Up and Going. Practiced writing some JS in the console.

### Day 13: February 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 150 minutes. Feeling great! Finished book 1 in the YDKJS series and started reading the second. Also, began reading Medium article on Pure CSS images. Started working on it in Brackets as well. Had some trouble and didn't finish but will tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Thinking that I will try to make JavaScript the first language I learn (and learn it well). I've heard that's one of the best things to do- learn your first language well and learn the fundamentals well so that's what I plan to do.


### Day 14: February 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Finished Pure CSS tutorial and created a Koala Bear.

### Day 23: February 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 35 minutes. Learned more about Jekyll through docs and started editing content from basic website iteration. Customizing my content then planning on customizing layout.

**Thoughts**: I like Jekyll! I like that you can write posts and if you set the date to a date in the future, they won't show until that date comes. It's like scheduling posts for the future without dealing with a scheduler. 


### Day 24: March 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 70 minutes. Learning more and more about Jekyll. Successfully created new pages and deployed my repository on Github Pages.

### Day 25: March 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 120 minutes - longest day yet. I spent a lot of time adding content to my website. I ran into some trouble though- I have a file on Github, in my repository that has the correct code for the main index.html file but when I visit my Github pages url, it shows the old file. Tomorrow, I'll work on fixing this.

### Day 28: March 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Made a lot of progress but lost it because of some issue with Brackets and Jekyll running at the same time. I learned that if I close the Terminal that is running "jekyll serve" before I save and close Brackets, Brackets won't save any of my changes. This is frustrating but I'm glad I figured it out. 

**Thoughts**: I am hoping to finish this basic portfolio soon and then get back to reading on Javascript. 


### Day 29: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 45 minutes. Worked on Portfolio. It's plain, like vanilla, but it's almost done for a basic website.

**Thoughts**: I swear, Brackets has a mind of it's own. I edited a page, hit ctrl + s and then clicked save all and moved onto to the next page to edit and when I returned to the previous page, Brackets had erased my code. Whaddup with that???


### Day 30: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Wrote my first blog post (very short) but it worked and is still there after the pull request and merge! 

**Thoughts**: So I keep editing my html pages, I click save and then create a pull request and merge the files but the text I added to the index.html pages disappears! I think it has something to do with the markdown files I've created for each page. I think I need to delete those.

**Thoughts**: This is pretty cool! Nervous but excited to read docs on how to add autocomplete feature.


### Day 90: May 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 90 minutes. Added autocomplete feature to input fieldon Yelpcamp. And got to 93% on WDB.

**Thoughts**: Impressed that I was able to find out how to do it so quickly! :D I read the official docs, looked on stackoverflow and then found a blog post on it. Had to fix a bug to make it work on the edit form but I figured it out all on my own!


### Day 91: May 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 70 minutes. Now at 94%. Created Heroku account. Learned how using it.

**Thoughts**: Feeling great! Super excited to be able to deploy apps soon.


### Day 92: May 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Not much progress. Still working on deploying app to Heroku.

**Thoughts**: I hope this last week isn't slow but it might be!


### Day 93: May 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Now at 96% on WDB.

**Thoughts**: Almost done!


### Day 94: May 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Now at 99% on WDB.

**Thoughts**: So close to finishing!  


### Day 95: May 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 72 minutes. Finished WDB! Started working on basic algorithms- Check Palindrones.

**Thoughts**: Feeling fantastic that I finished WDB! I can totally figure this out!


### Day 96: May 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 40 minutes. Solved the Check for Palindromes algorithm on FCC.

**Thoughts**: The code isn't very pretty but it works! I need to review the solutions on the FCC wikia soon.


### Day 97: May 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 70 minutes. Worked on FCC Basic Algorithms: Title Case a Sentence.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a little frustrated. I know what I want to do and I wrote the code to do it but it's just not working. I want to figure it out on my own though. I know I can.


### Day 98: May 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 70 minutes. Solved Return the Largest Numbers in Arrays algorithm. Almost solved Confirm the Ending.

**Thoughts**: I like algorithms! Makes me think back to math class in high school.


### Day 99: May 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 30 minutes. Worked on Truncate a String algorithm from FCC.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I can't believe tomorrow is my 100th day!


### Day 100: May 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 250 minutes- longest day of the entire challenge! Worked on Chunky Monkey, Roman Numeral and Where art thou FCC algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I can't believe it's over! I remember starting the challenge in February as if it were yesterday. It's crazy to think how much I've learned over these 100 days. I only missed 1 day the entire challenge. Now, I want to take a day or two to rest (I'll still be coding but in a less structured manner at least for a few days) and then I can write up a formal reflection to post on Medium.
